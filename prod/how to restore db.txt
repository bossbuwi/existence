1. Run command prompt as admin.
2. Change to the directory where the backup is located.
3. Run the following command:

pg_restore -U postgres -d database_name filename.tar

Where:
database_name = db_existence for production or db_test for test

Note:
Before restoring the backup, make sure that an empty database with the same name is existing. Otherwise, the restore will fail.
